Get all the appeasements in July month.
How do we differentiate between returns and appeasements?
Get all the below fields 
RETURN_ID
ENTRY_DATE 
RETURN_ADJUSTMENT_TYPE_ID
AMOUNT
COMMENTS 
ORDER_ID
ORDER_DATE 
RETURN_DATE
PRODUCT_STORE_ID

â€“ Appeasements are made for the shipping refund as well, appeasements are made at the order level and not at the item level, return (appeasements) can have more than one status like created, completed and received.
